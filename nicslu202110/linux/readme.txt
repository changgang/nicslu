From version 202006, we provide NICSLU libraries that use or do not use fused-multiply-add (FMA) intrinsic instructions. FMA is supported only by CPU architectures not older than Intel's Haswell (the 4th Core family) or AMD's Piledriver. NicsLU_Initialize checks whether your CPU supports such intrinsics and returns -15 if not. For the case of nonsupport, please use the FMA-disabled libraries and the cost is a small performance degradation.
